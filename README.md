# Malikowski Output indicators

Malikowski et. al (2007) proposed a research model for exploring the use of learning management systems (aka course management systems) such as Blackboard, Moodle etc. This project is developing code to support exploration of whether or not the "Malikowski" model can be useful in the generation of *output indicators*. Output indicators are seen as some measure of the consequences of learning and teaching.

The idea is to be able to use the Malikowski model to get an indication of what has happened in a course. While such an indication will be inherently limited, it may be better than what is currently available.

Initially, this code will be designed to work with the Moodle LMS across different institutions. It will be tested across two institutions.
